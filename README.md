# MERN E-commerce API with Cloudinary and Multer

> This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack e-commerce API that utilizes Cloudinary for image and video management and Multer for file uploading.
> The API allows users to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on products, categories, orders, and users.
> The API allows a client to connect, then create a new user, then edit and delete that user. The API allows a user to SIGN  IN which gives them a token that they can use for subsequent authenticated requests. The API allows the users to SIGN OUT,
 which invalidates their tokens...
